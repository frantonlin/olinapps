# OlinApps

An attempt to remake [OlinApps](http://www.olinapps.com/) from the ground up, using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). OlinApps is a central hub with links to useful Olin apps and resources. Additionally, it previously acted as a platform and base for other Olin-connected apps, such as FlyOlinFly.
